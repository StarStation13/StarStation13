///POSTERCODE///
///I'm not going to lie to you all, poster code is incredibly janky to work with and nowhere near clean. Unfortunately rolling all changes into this module is the best I can do.
///To compensate, I've not bothered with the standard hierarchy of the other modules and this one can be safely deleted with no real adverse effects if you wish.
///Do note some map adjustments may be required if you do.

///BASE ICON OVERRIDES///
///Overrides the normal /tg/ icons because, again, postercode bad

///These are a new poster type meant to be.. well, retro. ICly. Relatively.
///Functions identically to the other poster types besides being their own class.
